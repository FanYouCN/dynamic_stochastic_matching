# About

This respository includes python code for working paper: "An Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach to Dynamic Stochastic Matching" by Fan You and Thomas Vossen.

The code contains implementation of main model of the paper, benchmark approaches for comparision, numerical instance generation and experimentation.

## Dependencies
To replicate numerical experiments from the paper, or use the code to solve new dynamic stochastic matching instances, python packages `numpy`, `pandas`, `networkx`, as well as the `Gurobi` solver are required.
